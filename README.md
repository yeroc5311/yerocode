# yerocode
remaking the alphabet to make it look like spammed text™

this was made solely for fun, and vibe-coded with chatgpt (as i do).

using the MIT license, because i don't care much about what you do with like 3 files, lmao.

ready to learn this dumb code? look at `yerocode-alphabet.md`.

or be lazy and download/use `yerocode_cli.py`.
